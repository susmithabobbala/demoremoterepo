Infrastructure as Code
A fundamental principle of DevOps is to treat infrastructure the same way developers
treat code. Application code has a defined format and syntax. If the code is not written
according to the rules of the programming language, applications cannot be created.
Code is stored in a version-management system that logs a history of code
development, changes, and bug fixes. When code is compiled (built) into applications,
we expect a consistent application to be created. That is to say, the build is repeatable
and reliable.
